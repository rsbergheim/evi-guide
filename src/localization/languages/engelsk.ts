If weather and snow conditions on the day of the tour suggest that it cannot be carried out, participants will be offered alternative guided tours/events. In such cases, participants will pay for the tour that is conducted.",
    eviskiDescription1: "EVI was established in 2011, following Endre Hals's production and sale of custom-made skis under the brand Prog since 2009. EVI skis were founded as an alternative to global production and commerce. The ski factory at Øverlønset in Oppdal has also remained the only producer of alpine skis in Norway.",
    eviskiDescription2: "Every ski produced by EVI is designed to last forever. By replacing traditional construction methods that cannot be maintained and repaired, simplifying, and preserving all design history, EVI has created a system for the sale and repurchase of skis that are the world's first truly circular skis. Repressed skis, with a 'G' as the logo, were launched in 2016 and are now available for purchase. With the 'G' in EVI, we are now completing the process of creating a fully circular ski product.",
